## 🔍 Debugging and Development

### Browser Console
All classes log important events and state changes to the browser console for debugging.

### Global Access
Game instances are available globally for debugging:
```javascript
// Access game components in browser console
window.gameData.dataLoader()    // DataLoader instance
window.gameData.gameState()     // GameState instance  
window.gameData.quizEngine()    // QuizEngine instance
window.gameData.uiManager()     // UIManager instance
```

### Common Debug Commands
```javascript
// Get current game state
gameData.gameState().getStateSnapshot()

// Get quiz statistics
gameData.quizEngine().getQuizStatistics()

// Get UI state
gameData.uiManager().getUIState()

// Force unlock all rooms (debugging)
gameData.gameState().unlockedRooms.add('treasury')
```
