    "name": "Room Name",
    "description": "Room description",
    "connections": ["room1", "room2"],
    "questionCategory": "preferred_category"
  }
}
```

#### Questions (data/questions.json)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "q1",
    "question": "Question text?",
    "answers": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "points": 100,
    "category": "science",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "explanation": "Explanation text",
    "hint": "Helpful hint"
  }
]
```

#### Achievements (data/achievements.json)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "first_correct",
    "name": "First Steps",
    "description": "Answer your first question correctly",
    "icon": "🎯",
    "points": 50
  }
]
```

### Running the Game
1. **Direct Browser**: Open `game.html` directly in browser
2. **Local Server**: 
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Navigate to http://localhost:8080/game.html
   ```

### Development Testing
- **Phase 1**: Open `index.html` to test data loading
- **Phase 2**: Open `test-phase2.html` to test game state
- **Phase 3**: Open `test-phase3.html` to test quiz engine
- **Phase 4**: Open `game.html` for full game experience

## 🔍 Debugging and Development

### Browser Console
All classes log important events and state changes to the browser console for debugging.

### Global Access
Game instances are available globally for debugging:
```javascript
// Access game components in browser console
window.gameData.dataLoader()    // DataLoader instance
window.gameData.gameState()     // GameState instance  
window.gameData.quizEngine()    // QuizEngine instance
window.gameData.uiManager()     // UIManager instance
```

### Common Debug Commands
```javascript
// Get current game state
gameData.gameState().getStateSnapshot()

// Get quiz statistics
gameData.quizEngine().getQuizStatistics()

// Get UI state
gameData.uiManager().getUIState()

// Force unlock all rooms (debugging)
gameData.gameState().unlockedRooms.add('treasury')
```
